## Introduction

Open Data Capture is an easy-to-use web application designed for continuous clinical data capture. It offers users the ability to conduct both remote and in-person clinical assessments, storing the results in a secure, structured, and standardized manner. These results may be used for research purposes, or to drive powerful visualizations to better characterize service users and access internal service performance.

## Free and Open Source

Open Data Capture is [free and open source software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) developed by the [Douglas Neuroinformatics Platform](https://douglasneuroinformatics.ca/) for internal use at the [Douglas Research Centre](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/). This means that the [source code](https://github.com/DouglasNeuroInformatics/OpenDataCapture) is available for anyone to modify or deploy on their own private server. However, the DNP administers an instance of Open Data Capture on our [own server](https://docs.douglasneuroinformatics.ca/en/latest/about_the_platform/index.html#hardware), behind a firewall. As of February 2024, access to the platform is available on request. Please [contact us](support@douglasneuroinformatics.ca) for more information.
