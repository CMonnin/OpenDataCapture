### Diagnostic Tracking

The platform will allow users to track the progression of a given subject's diagnoses over time. Diagnoses will be stored according to a well-defined, hierarchical system, such as ICD-10.

### Medication Tracking

The platform is planned to feature the ability to track medications. This will be according to a standardized scheme, likely that published by Health Canada.
