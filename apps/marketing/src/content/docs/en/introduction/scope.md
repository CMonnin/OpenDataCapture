title: Scope
---

Open Data Capture is a comprehensive solution for safe and efficient storage of structured clinical data, including relevant quantitative information for research or performance improvement. This includes cognitive assessments (e.g., The Montreal Cognitive Assessment), symptom scales (e.g., The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms), and interactive tasks (e.g., the Stroop Test).

:::note
Open Data Capture is not an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and therefore it is not designed to capture or store qualitative notes.
