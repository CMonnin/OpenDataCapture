## Build System

These three workspaces are managed using Turborepo. In the file `turbo.json`, various tasks are defined which may be run from the command line using scripts defined in `package.json`.

## TypeScript

The entire codebase is written in Typescript, and each package has a `tsconfig.json` file that extends the `tsconfig.base.json` file located in the root of the monorepo. This allows for sharing of TypeScript configurations across all packages in the monorepo.

## ESLint

The `.eslintrc.json` file, located at the root of the monorepo, establishes the base linting configuration for all files. Within each workspace, the `.eslintrc.cjs` file extends this configuration by providing specific rules and/or overrides for that specific workspace.
