# Target Users

## Clinical Staff

The platform is designed primarily for clinical personnel, including doctors, nurses, and administrative assistants. These users will likely access the platform using Google Chrome on a desktop computer. It is safe to assume that the vast majority of these users will prefer a graphical user interface and will have little/no experience with the command line.

## Research Subjects

_The platform will eventually enable subjects to self-enter data on any device, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. In some cases, these users may suffer from cognitive impairments that affect their attention or memory. Therefore, any functionalities provided to this user class will be designed with accessibility in mind._

## Researchers

_The platform may also eventually be used by researchers, including principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. Among this class of users, there will likely be a range of technical abilities. The majority of researchers will likely have some experience with the command line, but will not be proficient. There will be a minority of power users (~10%) who would likely prefer to access data through a command line interface, or otherwise programmatically._
