# Data Visualization

## Single Subject

An interface is provided to visualize numeric measures over time in a single subject. Outcomes measures must be defined in the instrument.

## Aggregate

A visualization dashboard is provided to summarize all patients consenting to be included in research. This is implemented using [Redash](https://redash.io/). Redash is an open-source data visualization and collaboration platform that allows users to connect to various data sources, create and share interactive visualizations and dashboards, and collaborate with others on data analysis and exploration. It is designed to make it easy for users to query and explore data, regardless of their technical expertise or the size of their data.
