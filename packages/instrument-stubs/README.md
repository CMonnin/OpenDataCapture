# @opendatacapture/instrument-stubs

## About

This package contains example instruments that should be used exclusively for testing. Unlike `@opendatacapture/instrument-library`, this package is written in vanilla JavaScript, which is important to avoid the complications of transpilation in different environments (e.g., running esbuild in the browser vs in node).
