Open Data Capture and REDCap are both electronic data capture (EDC) platforms that offer a web-based interface to administer forms. However, while there is significant overlap between these platforms in terms of feature set, there are several key differences. In this article, we take a key look at both options, to help you determine which is best for your organization.

## Key Points

- REDCap has the concept of a project. Open Data Capture does not have any concept of a project. Although Open Data Capture may certainly be used for research projects, it is designed as a continuous data capture tool.
- Open Data Capture is modern and easy-to-use, whereas REDCap looks like it was built in the 90s
- Open Data Capture is open source, REDCap is proprietary (refer to other article on this)
- Open Data Capture offers additional capabilities including much better interactive instruments
- Open Data Capture has REST API with proper fine-grained access controls. REDCap has an API, but any API token issued includes full admin access, representing a threat to data security. 
- Open Data Capture and REDCap both offer remote assessment.
