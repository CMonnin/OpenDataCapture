# Introduction

Welcome to the Douglas Data Capture Platform technical documentation. These docs are written primarily for developers working on the platform. If you are interested in contributing to the platform (i.e., witting code), you are in the right place. If you are someone who is looking for documentation on how to use the platform, please refer to our user documentation (TBD).

## How to Use These Docs

If you are someone who is planning on making major contributions to many parts of the codebase (e.g., adding an interactive task to the site with associated API routes and database schemas), then it is highly recommended that you read through the docs like a book, skipping sections that you are already familiar with. On the other hand, if you are planning to work on a simple, specific, and isolated feature (e.g., changing the color of a button) then you can probably skip to the relevant sections.

## Prerequisites

To work on the repository, you should have a good understanding of basic web development, including HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6). If you are familiar with another high-level programming language, such as Python or Java, then I highly recommend reading [this overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Overview) to get started learning JavaScript. You should also be comfortable using TypeScript, as all of our non-trivial code is written in it, with strict mode enabled. If you do not already know JavaScript, you should first learn the basics of the language before delving into TypeScript. Then, I would recommend referring to the official TypeScript documentation. Additional prerequisite skills are largely dependent on the type of work you will be doing.
