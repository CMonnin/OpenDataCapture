# Administering Instruments

Instruments may be completed by users themselves. *Users may also delegate an instrument to a subject for the subject to complete the instrument themselves. The mechanism by which this feature will be implemented is yet to be determined.*

## Selecting an Instrument

For the end user, accessing the platform through the web client, they will be presented with a list of instruments, with a brief description of each. The exact instruments presented to the user will depend on the clinic the user is associated with, as described in the authentication section.

## Completing an Instrument

### Step 1: Review Details

First, the user will be asked to review the details of the instrument. *This may also include a consent form, or any licensing requirements*.

### Step 2: Enter Demographic Information

Next, the user will be required to enter the demographics information for the subject in question. This data is used to compute the subject's unique ID, and link the record to this individual in the database.

> **Important Note:** This will be replaced in the future as it is cumbersome for users. Potential options include autofill or the subject's hospital ID.

### Step 3: Complete the Instrument

Finally, the user will complete the instrument. The exact procedure for this will depend on the kind of instrument being completed.
