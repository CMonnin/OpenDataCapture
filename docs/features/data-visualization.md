# Data Visualization

A visualization dashboard is provided to summarize all patients consenting to be included in research. The exact visualizations implemented will depend on the specific needs of individual clinics. *In addition, all clinics will be offered an internal dashboard including patients not consenting to inclusion in research.*

These dashboards are implemented using [Redash](https://redash.io/). Redash is an open-source data visualization and collaboration platform that allows users to connect to various data sources, create and share interactive visualizations and dashboards, and collaborate with others on data analysis and exploration. It is designed to make it easy for users to query and explore data, regardless of their technical expertise or the size of their data.
