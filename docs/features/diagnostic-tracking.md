# Diagnostic Tracking

*The platform will allow users to track the progression of a given subject's diagnoses over time. Each subject will contain an array of diagnoses, which will be objects of a defined structure including timestamps. Diagnoses will be stored according to a well-defined, hierarchical system, such as Snomed or ICD-10.*
