Open Data Capture allows you to visualize numeric measures over time in a single subject. These measures must be defined in the instrument.

### Steps

<Steps>

1.  **Login to Open Data Capture**

    First, login to your instance of Open Data Capture. In order to visualize subject data, you must have adequate permissions. Usually, that means you must be a group manager (or equivalent).

2.  **Select Your Group**

    Next, select the group that you were using when you collected the data for this subject
    (or were using to send the subject a remote assignment). It is very important that
    you select the correct group, otherwise you will not see the expected data.
