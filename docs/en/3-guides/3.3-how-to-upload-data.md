Open Data Capture allows you to visualize numeric measures over time in a single subject. These measures must be defined in the instrument.

### Steps

<Steps>

1.  **Login to Open Data Capture**

    First, login to your instance of Open Data Capture. In order to visualize subject data, you must have adequate permissions. Usually, that means you must be a group manager (or equivalent).

2.  **Select Your Group**

    Next, select the group that you were using when you collected the data for this subject
    (or were using to send the subject a remote assignment). It is very important that
    you select the correct group, otherwise you will not see the expected data.

3.  **Select the Upload tab**

    Select the upload tab within the side navigation bar. This will reveal a page displaying all the Form instruments that are available in the current OpenDataCapture instance.

4.  **Select Instrument to Upload to**

    Select an instrument you would like to upload data to by clicking on its title within the displayed table. This action will bring you to the upload page for the selected instrument

5.  **Following Proper Upload Format**

    In order to properly upload data to the selected instrument, the data must follow a certain format. A sample of the instrument's data format can be seen by clicking the download template button. Once the template is downloaded, one can fill it with external data. The template includes pre-filled columns and sample data that specify data types for each field.

6.  **Uploading Using Dropzone**

    Once a template is filled it can be dragged and dropped into the fill dropzone. Once this is done the submit button is to be clicked and the data is then verified. If the data follows the correct syntax then it is submitted to said instrumented data table, else it display an error for which field is filled incorrectly.

7.  **Uploading specific Zod Data**

    Some forms may have Zod field types that are challenging to represent in a standard CSV format. Therefore, specific notations must be used to ensure the upload feature can properly parse the data.

    For example: If a form has a field that accepts a set of data, such as a multi-option checklist with options a, b, and c, the proper notation for the data would be:
    
    - SET(a,b)
    - SET(a,b,c)
    - SET(a)
    
    This format allows the upload feature to correctly interpret the selected options.
