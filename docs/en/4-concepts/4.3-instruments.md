### What is an Instrument?

Central to Open Data Capture is the concept of an instrument. Conceptually, an instrument is any tool that can be used to collect data. This can range from simple forms (e.g., a questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms) to complex interactive tasks (e.g., the Stroop Task).

Technically, an instrument is a just a [Plain Old JavaScript Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), which is composed of a key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary in Python.

In practice, however, instruments are defined in repositories containing a collection of source files. These sources are bundled together into a single asynchronous [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). This bundle conforms to the [ECMAScript 2022 Language Specification](https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/).

### An Instrument Repository

An instrument repository is a collection of source files that define an instrument, one of which is considered to be the index file. The index file must have a default export which defines the instrument.

To resolve the index file, the bundler checks for the following file names (in order):

- `index.tsx`
- `index.jsx`
- `index.ts`
- `index.js`
