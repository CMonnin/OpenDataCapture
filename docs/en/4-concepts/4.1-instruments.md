### What is an Instrument?

Central to Open Data Capture is the concept of an instrument. Conceptually, an instrument is any tool that can be used to collect data. This can range from simple forms (e.g., a questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms) to complex interactive tasks (e.g., the Stroop Task).

Technically, an _Instrument_ is a [JavaScript Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), which is composed of a key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary in Python. These objects define the properties of an instrument (e.g., a title and description).

### Understanding TypeScript

The structure of an _Instrument_ is defined in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) by the `Instrument` type, located in the internal [`schemas`](https://github.com/DouglasNeuroInformatics/OpenDataCapture/tree/main/packages/schemas) package. This definition is essentially a set of rules to validate that the key-value pairs in an _Instrument_ conform with expectations in the codebase. These rules are quite complex and **heavily** rely on the concept of [discriminated unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types) and [conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html). However, it is important to understand that TypeScript types do not exist at runtime; rather, they are used to provide compile-time checks (e.g., when developing a new _Instrument_). Ultimately, at runtime, an _Instrument_ is simply a JavaScript object.

:::note[Orthographic Convention]
In this documentation, the term "instrument" is used to refer to the concept of an instrument (i.e., any tool that can be used to collect data), whereas "Instrument" refers to a JavaScript object that is [assignable](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html) to the `Instrument` type in the codebase.

### Instrument Structure

#### Instrument Types

The `Instrument` type is a union of several members assignable to `BaseInstrument`, such as `FormInstrument` and `InteractiveInstrument`. Each member of the union has a distinct `kind` property which serves to discriminate its specific type.

For instance, consider an object `T` of type `Instrument`. Initially, we can only know that `T` is assignable to `BaseInstrument`. However, by examining `T["kind"]`, we can narrow the type of instrument: if `T["kind"]` equals `"FORM"`, then `T` is a `FormInstrument`; if it equals `"INTERACTIVE"`, then `T `is an `InteractiveInstrument`.

Now, consider the `content` property of an `Instrument` which defines the content in the instrument to be rendered to the user. For a `FormInstrument`, `content` contains the definition of the form to display to the user. On the other hand, for an `InteractiveInstrument`, then content contains a render function that will be invoked in an [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

#### Real-World Example

```typescript
const formInstrument = {
  kind: 'FORM',
  language: 'en',
  tags: ['Example'],
  internal: {
    edition: 1,
    name: 'HAPPINESS_QUESTIONNAIRE'
  },
  content: {
    overallHappiness: {
      description: 'Please select a number from 1 to 10 (inclusive)',
      kind: 'number',
      label: 'How happy are you overall?',
      max: 10,
      min: 1,
      variant: 'slider'
    }
  },
  details: {
    description: 'The Happiness Questionnaire is a questionnaire about happiness.',
    estimatedDuration: 1,
    instructions: ['Please answer the questions based on your current feelings.'],
    license: 'AGPL-3.0',
    title: 'Happiness Questionnaire'
  },
  measures: null,
  validationSchema: z.object({
    overallHappiness: z.number().int().min(1).max(10)
  })
};

const interactiveInstrument = {
  kind: 'INTERACTIVE',
  language: 'en',
  tags: ['EXAMPLE'],
  internal: {
    edition: 1,
    name: 'CLICK_THE_BUTTON_TASK'
  },
  content: {
    render(done) {
      // the timestamp when the render function is first called
      const start = Date.now();

      // create a <button> element and append it to the document <body>
      const button = document.createElement('button');
      button.textContent = 'Submit Instrument';
      document.body.appendChild(button);

      // attach a function to button we created, which is called when the 'click' event is triggered
      button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        done({ seconds: (Date.now() - start) / 1000 });
      });
    }
  },
  details: {
    description: 'This is a very simple interactive instrument.',
    estimatedDuration: 1,
    instructions: ['Please click the button when you are done.'],
    license: 'AGPL-3.0',
    title: 'Click the Button Task'
  },
  measures: null,
  validationSchema: z.object({
    seconds: z.number()
  })
};
```

### Instrument Sources

Theoretically, an instrument could be defined in the codebase

### Instrument Bundle (I)

In Open Data Capture, Instruments are almost always generated from an _Instrument Bundle_. An Instrument Bundle is [JavaScript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) that resolves to a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/J) of an Instrument. For example, supposing that an Instrument included only a name, the following would be an example of an Instrument Bundle:

```javascript
const instrumentBundle = "Promise.resolve({ name: 'Simplified Instrument' });";
const instrument = await eval(instrumentBundle);
console.log(instrument.name); // 'Simplified Instrument'
```

### Instrument Sources

In practice, these bundles are seldom written directly by end users. Instead, they are generated by the _Bundler_ from _Instrument Sources_, which are the files that define an instrument. These files are stored in a directory, which must include an index file. This serves as the entry point for the instrument and must include a default export that defines the instrument

To resolve the index file, the bundler checks for the following file names (in order):

- `index.tsx`
- `index.jsx`
- `index.ts`
- `index.js`

If none of these files exist, the Bundler throws an exception.

In many cases, _Instrument Sources_ may include one an index file. For example, if we convert the previous example to _Instrument Sources_:

**index.js**

```javascript
export default Promise.resolve({ name: 'Simplified Instrument' });
```

### Instrument Bundle (II)

From these sources, the Bundler generates a single asynchronous [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). This output conforms to the [ECMAScript 2022 Language Specification](https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/) and can be executed in any modern browser.

For example, the Bundler might generate the following output:

```javascript
"(async () => ({ name: 'Simplified Instrument' }))();";
```
