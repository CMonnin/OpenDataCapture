### What is an Instrument?

Central to Open Data Capture is the concept of an instrument. Conceptually, an instrument is any tool
that can be used to collect data. This can range from simple forms (e.g., a questionnaire assessing
depressive symptoms) to complex interactive tasks (e.g., the Stroop Task).

Technically, an _Instrument_ is a [JavaScript Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object),
which is composed of a key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary in Python. These objects define the properties of
an instrument (e.g., a title and description).

### Understanding TypeScript

The structure of an _Instrument_ is defined in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) by
the `Instrument` type, located in the internal [`schemas`](https://github.com/DouglasNeuroInformatics/OpenDataCapture/tree/main/packages/schemas)
package. This definition is essentially a set of rules to validate that the key-value pairs in an _Instrument_
conform with expectations in the codebase. These rules are quite complex and **heavily** rely on the concept
of [discriminated unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types) and
[conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html). However, it is important
to understand that TypeScript types do not exist at runtime; rather, they are used to provide compile-time checks
(e.g., when developing a new _Instrument_). Ultimately, at runtime, an _Instrument_ is simply a JavaScript object.

:::note[Orthographic Convention]
In this documentation, the term "instrument" is used to refer to the concept of an instrument
(i.e., any tool that can be used to collect data), whereas "Instrument" refers to a JavaScript
object that is [assignable](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html)
to the `Instrument` type in the codebase.

### Instrument Structure

#### Instrument Types

The `Instrument` type is a union of several members assignable to `BaseInstrument`, such as
`FormInstrument` and `InteractiveInstrument`. Each member of the union has a distinct `kind`
property which serves to discriminate its specific type.

For instance, consider an object `T` of type `Instrument`. Initially, we can only know that `T`
is assignable to `BaseInstrument`. However, by examining `T["kind"]`, we can narrow the
type of instrument: if `T["kind"]` equals `"FORM"`, then `T` is a `FormInstrument`; if it
equals `"INTERACTIVE"`, then `T `is an `InteractiveInstrument`.

Now, consider the `content` property of an `Instrument` which defines the content
in the instrument to be rendered to the user. For a `FormInstrument`, `content` contains
the definition of the form to display to the user. On the other hand, for an `InteractiveInstrument`,
then content contains a render function that will be invoked in an [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

### Instrument Sources

Theoretically, an instrument could be defined in the codebase as a simple JavaScript object. For example, the following
is an example of a simple form instrument:

```ts
const formInstrument = {
  kind: 'FORM',
  language: 'en',
  tags: ['Example'],
  internal: {
    edition: 1,
    name: 'HAPPINESS_QUESTIONNAIRE'
  },
  content: {
    overallHappiness: {
      description: 'Please select a number from 1 to 10 (inclusive)',
      kind: 'number',
      label: 'How happy are you overall?',
      max: 10,
      min: 1,
      variant: 'slider'
    }
  },
  details: {
    description: 'The Happiness Questionnaire is a questionnaire about happiness.',
    estimatedDuration: 1,
    instructions: ['Please answer the questions based on your current feelings.'],
    license: 'AGPL-3.0',
    title: 'Happiness Questionnaire'
  },
  measures: null,
  validationSchema: z.object({
    overallHappiness: z.number().int().min(1).max(10)
  })
};
```

However, in real-world situations this strategy is quite limiting for interactive instruments. Often,
an interactive instrument includes a number of other files, such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript, as
well as other assets such as fonts and images. In addition, if instruments could only be defined
in the code base, adding even one additional instrument would require a total rebuild of at
least some of the application. For these reasons, instruments are generated from instrument
sources; instrument sources are the files that define an instrument.

For a very simple instrument, such as the example above, the instruments
sources may be a single file. This file would then be considered the index
file. The index file is the entry point to the instrument. This file must
have as its default export a valid instrument.

### Instrument Bundler

Although we have thusfar discussed files, the instrument bundler is platform-agnostic, and
does not rely on the file system. Instead, it accepts an array of inputs; an input is an object
containing a name and source (like a virtual file). These inputs are then bundled
into a single output. This is done using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) with a custom plugin.

To resolve the index file, the bundler checks for the following names (in order):

- `index.tsx`
- `index.jsx`
- `index.ts`
- `index.js`

Once found, this index file is injected into a string which is passed as the input to esbuild. For example,
if the index file is `index.js`, then it is passed the following string:

`import instrument from './index.js'; var __exports = instrument;`

Our custom plugin assumes responsibility for resolving all imports found. In this case, we resolve the static
relative import `'./index.js` which exists in the inputs. We then return the content of the index input to
esbuild for further processing. In this case, esbuild will look for imports in the content of the index,
and pass any results to our resolver. The resolver marks any dynamic imports starting with `/` as
external (e.g., import('/runtime/foo.js)'). It looks for any static imports inside the inputs and
throws an exception if it is not found. If it is found, the content is passed to esbuild and
the bundling process continues.

Ultimately, this results in one JavaScript virtual file being generated, and one CSS virtual
file being generated (if CSS is imported). If applicable, the CSS file is a bundle of
all stylesheets used by the instrument.

Since we know that the JavaScript file contains a variable `__exports` which is the
default export of the instrument, the CSS is converted to base64 and inserted
into the JavaScript bundle as follows:

Then, when rendering interactive instruments, a script looks for the special `content.__injectHead`
property and decodes the styles if found. This is inserted into the document head
before the `render` method is called.

```js
// lots of stuff generated by esbuild
var __exports = index_default;
__exports.content.__injectHead.style = '...'; // base64 encoded string
```

This new content is then passed into the esbuild transpiler as a
single asynchronous [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)
that resolves to a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/J) of an Instrument. This output
conforms to the [ECMAScript 2022 Language Specification](https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/) and can be executed in any modern browser.
At this point, the code can be minified and tree shaken (i.e., dead code removed).

For example:

```js
`(async () => {
  // code with styles injected (if applicable)
  return __exports;
} )()`;
```

### Storage

This bundle is then stored in the database. It can be evaluated in the global scope
(using indirect eval or the `Function` constructor) at runtime.
