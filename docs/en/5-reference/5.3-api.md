Our REST API is built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). For a quick introduction to NestJS, we recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M8AYU_hPas).

### Modular Structure

In Nest, modules are used to organize the application into smaller, manageable pieces. Each module contains a group of related controllers, services, pipes, guards, and filters that all work together to perform a specific function or set of functions.

Controllers handle the incoming HTTP requests, and are responsible for handling the request, validating the inputs, and returning a response. Services are used to encapsulate the business logic of the application, and can be used by multiple controllers.

### OpenAPI

The NestJS Swagger module is used to automatically generate the OpenAPI specification for the application. This is stored in  
the form of an `openapi.json` file. In Open Data Capture, this specification is used with [redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) to document our core REST API.
