In addition to the core platform, an additional service (the "Gateway") is available for external data collection. The architecture of this platform is engineered for compliance purposes. In our implementation, the core platform is deployed within the firewall of the Douglas. The Gateway, on the other hand, is deployed on a droplet accessible on the open internet.

When a clinical assigns an instrument to a subject, the Gateway receives a blob of data, including the subject ID, instrument structure, and a public key. The Gateway uses this data to generate a one-time link for the subject to complete the instrument. Once completed, this data is be encrypted using the public key and stored in the Gateway Database; the data cannot be encrypted without the private key, which remains within the Douglas firewall. Periodically, the Core API requests data from the Gateway, at which point it is decrypted and inserted into the Core Database and removed from the Gateway Database.
