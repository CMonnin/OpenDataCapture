The runtime is based on native ES modules (ESM). Since the majority of packages are written in CommonJS (CJS), we transpile them to ESM. For the greatest compatibility, CJS exports are exported both as the default export and as named exports.

### Legacy Packages

Certain legacy packages, that predate either CJS or ESM, are copied directly into the Open Data Capture repository and modified for compatibility purposes.
