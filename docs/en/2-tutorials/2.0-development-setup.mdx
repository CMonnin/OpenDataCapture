This tutorial describes the procedure to run Open Data Capture on your local system in development mode. For information on how to deploy Open Data Capture in production, please refer to our [deployment guide](/en/tutorials/deployment/).

### System Prerequisites

This setup is designed for Unix-like operating systems and has been tested on MacOS and Linux. We do not support running Open Data Capture on Windows. For Windows users, we recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

#### Required Packages

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="MacOS">
  First, make sure that [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed on your system. This will also ensure that the Xcode
  Command Line Tools are available. Then, install the following packages:
  
  ```sh
  brew install bash jq 
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Ubuntu">
  Please ensure that the following packages are installed:

  ```sh
  apt-get install build-essential jq
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Arch Linux">
  Please ensure that the following packages are installed:

  ```sh
  pacman -S base-devel curl git jq
  ```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Git Setup

We use Git for version control and host our source code on GitHub. Please fork [our repository](https://github.com/DouglasNeuroInformatics/OpenDataCapture) and clone your fork:

```sh
# Replace 'DouglasNeuroinformatics' with your GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/DouglasNeuroInformatics/OpenDataCapture
```

Next, navigate to the root of the repository:

```sh
cd OpenDataCapture
```

### Configuration

All of the required configuration is stored in the file `.env`, which can be generated from `.env.template` using the following script:

```sh
./scripts/generate-env.sh && source .env
```

### System Dependencies

Now, in order to run the code, we need to install some additional system dependencies (i.e., a JavaScript runtime and database).

#### Node.js

Although Open Data Capture primarily uses the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) JavaScript runtime, several core pieces of functionality rely on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). We use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to manage the supported Node version. Please follow the installation instruction to install nvm on your system. Then, install the current Node version with the following command:

```sh
nvm install $(cat .nvmrc)
```

:::note
This is not the only way to manage Node versions. If you have another preferred method, feel free to use it. However, we strongly recommend against using a system installation of Node.

#### Bun

Now that you have installed Node, we can install Bun. To install the recommended version through npm, you can use the following command:

```sh
npm install -g bun@$(cat package.json | jq .packageManager | grep -o '[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+')
```

#### MongoDB

Now, you need to setup a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) instance. There are several ways you can do this. Please follow the guide for your prefered method:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Docker (Recommended)">
		First, make sure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system (for installation instructions, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)).
    Then, launch the MongoDB container:

    ```sh
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
    ```

    Once the container is running, we need to create a replication set, as is [required by Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/8266). This can be done with the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml exec mongo mongosh --eval "rs.initiate({_id: 'rs0', members: [{_id: 0, host: 'localhost:27017'}]});"
    ```

    </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="System Install (MacOS)">
    TBD
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Runtime Dependencies

Next, install runtime dependencies using Bun:

```sh
bun install
```

> Note: If you encounter an error here (e.g., segmentation fault), or the proccess appears to hang, simply try again. This is often sufficient to resolve issues with Bun.

### Setup Database

Now, we need to generate the database schemas:

```sh
bun ws database db:generate && bun ws database db:push
```

### Run Dev Server

Now, you should be able to start the development server, which is configured with hot module replacement.

```shell
bun dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be greeted with a setup screen. Follow the instructions to create the first admin user and seed the database.
