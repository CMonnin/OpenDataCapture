Welcome to our deployment guide! This resource is designed to be accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

### Server Configuration

Before continuing, please ensure the following:

- You have root access on a Linux-based server
- Ports 80 and 443 are exposed to the internet
- You own a domain name and have appropriately configured the DNS records

### Docker

Our deployment relies on Docker. Please ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server. For more details, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

> **Note:** These instructions were written in August 2023 using Docker version 24.0.2 and Docker Compose version 2.18.1.

### Setup

Now that the application is running, you need to send an HTTP request to a special setup endpoint. This will allow you to create the first admin user and optionally, to setup some initial dummy data. Please be advised that this action can only be performed if the database is completely empty.

```shell
SITE_ADDRESS=localhost:80
curl --request POST \
  --url $SITE_ADDRESS/api/v1/setup \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "admin": {
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "Password123"
    },
    "initDemo": true
}'
```
