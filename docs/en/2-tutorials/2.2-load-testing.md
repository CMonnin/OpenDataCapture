Once your server is up and running, you should perform load testing to make sure it can handle the expected amount of traffic with adequate performance. We recommend using [k6](https://github.com/grafana/k6) for this purpose.

### Prerequisites

First, [install k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/set-up/install-k6/) for your operating system. For example, on MacOS:

```shell
brew install k6
```

:::note
This tutorial was written using k6 v0.51.0 (go1.22.3, darwin/arm64).

### Running Tests

In the Open Data Capture repository, there is a package `@opendatacapture/k6` that contains an example of load testing with our public demo.

```shell
cd testing/k6
```

Once you are in that repository, you can run the example with the following command:

```
pnpm run test:demo
```
