## Open Data Capture

Open Data Capture is a modern, easy-to-use web application developed to enable the continuous collection and storage of research data. It is designed to meet the needs of clinical researchers at the Douglas Research Centre, one of the worldâ€™s leading mental health research institutions.

This documentation provides a detailed overview of Open Data Capture and is divided into several sections. The introduction outlines our motivations for creating this platform, describes the project's scope, and provides an overview of the principles underlying its development. This is a good starting point for anyone interested in the platform to gain a broad understanding of the platform's purpose. The features section is intended as a high-level, conceptual overview of the platform's capabilities. Later sections are intended primarily for a technical audience, including project developers and system administrators.

> **Important Note:** Open Data Capture is currently in active development and any feature described in these docs may be subject to breaking changes. Please note that _italicized text_ indicates features that are planned but have not yet been implemented.
