## The Douglas Data Capture Platform: Official Documentation

The Douglas Data Capture Platform is a modern, easy-to-use web application designed to enable the continuous collection and storage of research data. It was developed to meet the needs of clinical researchers at the Douglas Research Centre, one of the worldâ€™s leading mental health research institutions. 

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Douglas Data Capture Platform, and is divided into several sections. The introduction outlines our motivations for creating this platform, describes the scope of the project, and provides a high-level, conceptual overview of the key features implemented. This is a good starting point for anyone interested in the platform to get a broad understanding of the platform's purpose and capabilities. Later sections are intended primarily for a technical audience, including project developers and system administrators.
