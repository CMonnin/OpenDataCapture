## Background

The Douglas Data Capture Platform is a modern, easy-to-use web application designed to enable the continuous collection and storage of research data. It was developed to meet the specific needs of clinical researchers at the Douglas Research Centre, one of the world's leading mental health research institutions. However, it is fully open-source and can be easily adapted for use by other research institutions and organizations. Our hope is that this platform will ultimately lead to the advancement of medical knowledge and the betterment of patient care.

## Scope

The principal objective of this platform is to provide a secure and efficient way to store structured clinical research data. This includes any quantitative data that is relevant to research and/or general performance improvement. The Douglas Data Capture Platform is not an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and therefore, the capture or storage of qualitative notes is beyond the scope of this project. However, the structured research data collected by the platform can be extracted by the user in PDF form, which may be entered into an EHR by clinician, subject to legal requirements in their jurisdiction.
