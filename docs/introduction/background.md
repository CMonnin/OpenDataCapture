# Background

The Douglas Data Capture Platform was developed by the Douglas Neuroinformatics Platform, a small team of technical personnel at the Douglas Research Centre in Montreal, Canada. We were awarded a government grant which, among other things, provided us with a mandate to improve digital mental health services at the Douglas. Central to this mandate was providing a standardized, secure, and easy-to-use solution for clinical data capture and storage. 

Our objective was to create a platform that would modernize the current clinical research data management systems used across the Douglas, which varied widely across clinics. These systems typically consisted of spreadsheets with inconsistent and undocumented naming conventions, or loose collections of printed documents or handwritten notes, which were exchanged through email, physical transfer, or fax. 

Our vision for the Douglas Data Capture Platform was to provide an integrated solution that would entirely eliminate these disparate, obsolete practices. In so doing, the platform has the potential to greatly enhance data sharing and open science, while also ensuring a higher level of patient privacy and data security.
