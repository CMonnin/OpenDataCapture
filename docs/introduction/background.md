The Douglas Data Capture Platform is a modern, easy-to-use web application designed to enable the continuous collection and storage of research data. It was developed to meet the specific needs of clinical researchers at the Douglas Research Centre, one of the world's leading mental health research institutions. However, it is fully open-source and can be easily adapted for use by other research institutions and organizations. Our hope is that this platform will ultimately lead to the advancement of medical knowledge and the betterment of patient care.
