# Project Scope

The primary objective of the Douglas Data Capture Platform is to provide a safe and efficient method for storing structured clinical research data, including any quantitative information that is relevant to research or performance improvement. It is important to note that this platform is not an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and therefore it is not designed to capture or store qualitative notes.

As a consequence of the collection of this structured data, the platform will also achieve two additional objectives:

1. To provide authorized users with real-time access to a dashboard that displays summary information about clients
2. To provide authorized users with an easy way to extract collected data, including filtering by date collected, age, and sex
