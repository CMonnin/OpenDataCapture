# Project Scope

The Douglas Data Capture Platform aims to provide a method for safe and efficient storage of structured clinical research data, including relevant quantitative information for research or performance improvement. This includes cognitive assessments (e.g., The Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and symptom scales (e.g., The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms).

> **Important Note:** The Douglas Data Capture Platform is not an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and therefore it is not designed to capture or store qualitative notes.

As a consequence of the collection of this structured data, the platform will also achieve two additional objectives:
1. To provide authorized users with real-time access to a dashboard that displays summary information about clients
2. To provide authorized users with an easy way to extract collected data, including filtering by date collected, age, and sex
