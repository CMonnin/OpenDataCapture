# Project Scope

Open Data Capture is a comprehensive solution for safe and efficient storage of structured clinical research data, including relevant quantitative information for research or performance improvement. This includes cognitive assessments (e.g., The Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and symptom scales (e.g., The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms).

> **Important Note:** Open Data Capture is not an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and therefore it is not designed to capture or store qualitative notes.

As a consequence of the collection of this structured data, the platform also aims to:

1. Provide authorized users with real-time access to a dashboard that displays summary information about clients
2. Provide authorized users with an easy way to extract collected data
