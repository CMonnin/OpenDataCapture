## About

Open Data Capture is an integrated suite of applications tailored for the continuous and longitudinal collection of both clinical and research data. This platform is anchored on a few foundational principles:
- Versatility in Instruments: Whether it's surveys, clinical questionnaires, interactive tasks, or neuroimaging data, our platform can handle it all under the umbrella of a generic instrument.
- User-Friendly Design: Designed with the user in mind, its intuitive interface ensures that even those without specialized knowledge can navigate and utilize the platform with ease.
- Streamlined Deployment: With our one-liner deployment solution, leverage Docker Compose for a hassle-free, automated setup.

## Key Features

- Interactive form creation tool with seamless registration and database retrieval
- Overview page to summarize available data
- Active subject concept for easy input of multiple instruments for a single client during a session
- Fully bilingual with support for additional languages ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
- Interface for easy graphing of measures from multiple instruments for a subject
- Data export capability
- Subject search in the database based on identifying information (e.g., full name, age, sex)
- Printable/copyable summary at the end of each instrument
- Fine-grained user permissions for enhanced security
- Well-documented REST API

## Quick Start (Development)

### Setup Environment, Install Dependencies, and Launch Dev Server
```shell
awk -v secret_key="$(openssl rand -hex 16)" '/^SECRET_KEY=/{print $0 secret_key;next}1' .env.template > .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Create Admin User
```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url "${SITE_ADDRESS}/api/v1/setup" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "admin": {
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "Password123"
    },
    "initDemo": true
}'
```
